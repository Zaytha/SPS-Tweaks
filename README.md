# Zaytha's SPS Tweaks
This patcher edits [VRCFury's](https://vrcfury.com/) SPS to add support for [SideFXLab's Vertex Animation Textures](https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs).

This patcher doesn't do any of the VATs, just places the call to the function before SPS's bezier step. It requires a shader with VAT support to function properly, [which currently is only this modified version of poiyomi](hehe)
